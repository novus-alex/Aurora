# Aurora
Aurora project, started in 2019.
This project is based on self-learning to build an autonomous rocket.
To use those files, make sure to got 2 Arduino boards, 1 Raspberry-pi (I used Raspberry-pi zero w), Python3.0 minimum and those libraries (Flask, SocketIO, Serial and other you could see in the attach text) and Arduino's libraries

Thanks to Teo, Trystan to help me in this project

## Aurora_3D_files
Those files was created on Fusion360, please comment if you want the Fusion360 files
To print it, I used PLA basic (like Amazon Basic PLA, Nozzle Temp. 190-220°C and Bed Temp. 40-55°C)
